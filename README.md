## Problem Type
Regression (Supervised Learning)

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to predict the sales amount of chocolate products based on features such as sales person, country, product type, and date.
This is formulated as a regression problem because the target variable is numerical and continuous. The model is expected to learn the relationship between input features and the sales amount in order to estimate future sales values.

## Target Variable
Amount
The Amount column represents the total sales value for each transaction and serves as the dependent variable in this supervised learning task.

##  Dataset Description
Dataset Name: Chocolate Sales Dataset
Source: Kaggle (Open-source dataset platform)
Format: CSV (Tabular data)
Number of Records: 3,282
Number of Features: 6

## Key Features:
Sales Person
Country
Product
Date
Amount (Target Variable)
Boxes Shipped
The dataset satisfies the lab requirements as it is tabular, reasonably sized, and suitable for regression analysis.

## Methodology Overview
